I've been asked sometimes what was interesting I did during my 5+ years of mobile development. So here's the list of some of them:

## Mobile stuff
Objective-C, C, JavaScript, a tiny bit of Java and, of cource, Swift. CoreData & pure SQLite as databases.

### Hardware connectivity
- remote controlling TVs & Set-up boxes (reverse-engineered the private protocol with Wireshark)
- MFi: connectivity to Bluetooth devices (Game controllers & custom made)
- Bluetooth LE connectivity
- getting data from in-car hardware data sensors (ProtoBuf over WiFi TCP & UDP)

### Mobile payment
- Payment Library for 3rd party developers & Client App (with ability of White-labeling)
- Shopping apps with payments, loyalty points (BroadLeaf, Magento, etc)
- Apps for Merchants

### Security
- TV guide App with Live encoded streaming, EPG, etc
- Media sharing app with high security (SSL, 3-way sertificates, custum algoritms using OpenSSL)

### Other
- VoIP SIP apps, Asterisk, Avaya (server side setup & client side coding)
- Location based apps
- Porting iOS apps to Mac
- OpenSource projects & libraries
- One of first committers to CocoaPods
- Cross platform development: PhoneGap, Titanium, Marmelade
- runtime-hacking, reverse-engineering, benchmarking, performance optimizatios

## Web services
PHP, Ruby on Rails, Node.JS and a bit of Python. MongoDB, MySQL, Redis and others as databases.

- REST APIs
- Location services: GeoJSON, storage, search & retrival
- custom CMSs
- high load apps (with autoscaling on Amazon)
- data re-structuring, streaming & proxying
- custom CaptivePortal with Authentication & Authorization for connecting Facebook, user data, RADIUS (in cloud), WiFi access-points & mobile devices (WISPr)

Most of projects I did myself, some of them with another developer. I'll add more when I'll remember :)
